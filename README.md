Craetive Portion

I added 3 buttons to convert the currency of the final calculated price to either USD, Euros, or Pounds. I tried also having the buttons change the display value of the item price text box, but apparently doing so breaks the text box. I made the final price display include a variable for the conversion rate (the displayed price being final price * conversion ratio). The conversion ratios used were 1.00 (for USD), 0.91 (for Euros), and 0.77 (for Pounds).

I originally wanted to implement the conversion rate feature as a text field, but figured it wouldn't be different enough from what was already implemented in the lab. I was debating adding more kinds of currency conversions (such as the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen), but decided that in terms of the lab, the idea of what I'm doing is the same, and the number of currency conversions isn't important, since I'd be able to have a drop-down box or expanded list of some sort, if I was making a more complex app.
